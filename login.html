Explanation of Key Components
Head Section:

<title>: Sets the title that appears in the browser tab.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">: Links an external CSS file named styles.css for applying styles to this HTML page.
<link rel="icon" href="logo.webp">: Sets the favicon that appears in the browser tab, assuming a file named logo.webp is located in the same directory.
Body Section:

Container (.container): This main container wraps all the content on the page, including headings, buttons, and sections.

Header (<h1>): Displays the primary title of the application.

Buttons:

Spotify Login Button (<button id="spotify-login-btn">): Button element with an ID to initiate the Spotify login process.
YouTube Music Login Button (<button id="youtube-login-btn">): Button element with an ID to initiate the YouTube Music login process.
Playlist Selector Section (#playlist-selector):

Contains a subheading (<h2>) that serves as an instructional text, prompting users to log in and select the playlist they wish to transfer.
This section is informational only and does not contain any interactive elements.
JavaScript Link (<script src="app.js">):

Links an external JavaScript file named app.js, which contains the logic for handling user login, API interactions, and playlist transfer.
This structure sets up the basic layout and functionality for a user to log in to Spotify or YouTube Music, select a playlist, and presumably initiate a playlist transfer process.
